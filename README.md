## About me

Hi, I'm interested to make many elements of Chiniquy's family archive, and some of his publications, letters, and other historical proofs available to general public.
This archive was graciously made available to me from the Chiniquy.ca site.  There is an incredible amount of original scanned material coming from Chiniquy's family physical archives.

Why I'm so motivated? A lot of things were told about Chiniquy, which had many enemies in the catholic church. Some historians made comments too, and put some doubts on some Chiniquy accounts because lack of physical proof. This project is intented to make new material available for free consultation.
Anybody interested in having access to the full archive, can contact Chiniquy.ca which will provide the whole (very large) content on a USB Stick for a modest fee.
